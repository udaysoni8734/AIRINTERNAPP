# AIRINTERNAPP
First of all create a project in Andriod studio with NO ACTIVITY then next Given some name to your project ,(language = kotlin , minimum sdk = 8.0) then finish .
Then locationofandriodstudiofile/ for me it is = C:\Users\uday\AndroidStudioProjects\MyApplication2\app\src :- after this copy main from my first folder for first question then 3 files are uploaded on github so check once is it same or not if its not then please copy the code again from file and paste it in the file which you have opened .
Similarly do it for second one.
for you I am uploading screen shots also so check it no fake things are done here.
